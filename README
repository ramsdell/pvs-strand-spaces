This package contains several libraries of PVS theories for reasoning
about strand spaces, state, and security goals.  The theories are
covered by a BSD-style license, see license.txt.

This package offers two formulations of strand spaces.  All of the
original work assumes the message algebra is an initial algebra.  This
assumption simplifies the theory of the message algebra because there
is no need to define and consider matching and substitution.  Our work
on protocols and state makes use of this simplifying assumption.

In an effort to support future work on protocol transformations and
security goals, the new formulation of strand spaces makes use of a
message algebra that is a free algebra generated by an infinite set of
message variables.  It specifies a matching algorithm and verifies its
correctness.
