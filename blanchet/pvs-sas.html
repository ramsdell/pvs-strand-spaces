<p>The Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer
  (<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cpsa">CPSA</a>)
  attempts to enumerate all essentially different executions possible
  for a cryptographic protocol.  We call them the shapes of the
  protocol.  Naturally occurring protocols have only finitely many,
  indeed very few shapes.  Authentication and secrecy properties are
  easy to determine from them, as are attacks and anomalies.</p>

<p>For each input problem, the CPSA program is given some initial
  behavior, and it discovers what shapes are compatible with
  it. Normally, the initial behavior is from the point of view of one
  participant. The analysis reveals what the other participants must
  have done, given the participant's view.</p>

<p>A method for extracting a sentence in an order-sorted variant of
  First-Order Logic that completely characterizes a run of CPSA was
  presented in
  [<a href="#arXiv.org:1204.0480">arXiv.org:1204.0480</a>].  The
  sentence is modeled by realized skeletons.  The key result of the
  paper is that if a security goal expressed in the same language is
  derivable from the sentence, than it too is satisfied by all
  realized skeletons, and therefore, the protocol satisfies the stated
  security goal.</p>

<p>CPSA comes with a program that extracts sentences from its runs as
  S-expressions.  It also has a small program that translates the
  S-expressions
  into <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/">Prover9</a>
  syntax, although the sort information is ignored.  If Prover9 is
  able deduce the Prover9 translation of the security goal from the
  sentence, then once again, the protocol satisfies the stated
  security goal.</p>

<p>What can one conclude when a security goal cannot be derived
  from a sentence?  Does it mean the security goal is false, or the
  sentence is not relevant?  Or perhaps there is a general axiom about
  Strand Spaces that is missing.  The set
  of <a href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/">PVS</a> theories enclosed
  provides a way to answer such questions.</p>

<p>The PVS theories specify the concept of a Strand Space bundle, the
  Strand Space model of an execution of a protocol.  Unlike
  [<a href="#arXiv.org:1204.0480">arXiv.org:1204.0480</a>], bundles
  are used to model sentences, not realized skeletons.  The definition
  of what an adversary can derive is unnecessary when bundles are used
  to determine if a sentence is satisfied.</p>

<p>The enclosed version of a bundle differs from the usual one in that
  the message algebra is an initial algebra, and algebra variables
  never occur.  Instead, logical variables often replace algebra
  variables.  The advantage of eliminating algebra variables is there
  is no need to specify the unification and matching algorithms used
  by CPSA as PVS functions.  The use of an initial algebra makes is so
  that PVS's built in unification and matching algorithms perform the
  equivalent task.</p>

<p>Replacing algebra variables by logical variables isn't always
  straightforward.  Consider the situation for roles.  In CPSA, a role
  includes a trace that is used as a template for strands instantiated
  from the role.  In particular, the algebra variables in the trace
  are mapped into messages in the strand to establish that the strand
  is an instance of the given role.  The lack of algebra variables
  makes the concept of role traces as a template unworkable.
  The <tt>roles</tt> theory formalizes a role as a set of all possible
  instantiations of the role.</p>

<p>The recommended approach to the understanding theories within is to
  begin with the <tt>blanchet</tt> theory with
  [<a href="#arXiv.org:1204.0480">arXiv.org:1204.0480</a>] in view.
  The theory first defines the roles in Blanchet's Simple Example
  Protocol.  It then defines the shape analysis sentence produced by
  CPSA as a result of a run from the responder's point-of-view.  Take
  some time to compare this version of the sentence to the one in the
  paper.</p>

<p>The remainder of the theory proves that an underivable security
  goal is in fact not satisfiable.  It does so by presenting a bundle
  that serves as a counterexample.  That bundle is shown to satisfy
  the hypothesis of the shape analysis sentence and the sentence
  itself, so it is relevant.  Finally, the bundle is shown to model
  the negation of the security goal.</p>

<p>A short description of the other theories within follows.
  The <tt>init_alg</tt> theory defines the initial algebra related to
  the one in [<a href="#arXiv.org:1204.0480">arXiv.org:1204.0480</a>].
  The <tt>traces</tt> theory defines a message event and sequences of
  events.  It also defines the concept of message origination and
  similar ideas.  The <tt>strand_spaces</tt> theory defines a Strand
  Space as a finite sequence of traces, and the concept of an atom
  that never originates within a Strand Space.  The <tt>bundles</tt>
  theory defines a bundle and shows that an atom is never carried iff
  it never originates.  The proof uses induction over the node
  ordering relation implied by the bundle's before relation.  The
  induction is well-founded because the underlying graph is acyclic.
  The <tt>roles</tt> theory defines role traces as sets of instances
  instead of templates as discussed above.  It also defines the notion
  of a role assignment for a bundle.  The <tt>adversary</tt> theory
  defines the adversary's roles.  It also specifies the adversary
  derivability function associated with the initial algebra, however
  this function is currently unused.  The remaining theories specify
  finite strict orders and nonempty finite sequences.</p>

<p>The current version of the theories provides no support for
  listener strands.  In a framework in which bundles serves as models,
  they are not needed.  One simply asserts the existences of nodes
  that transmit desired values, and possibly orderings for those
  nodes.</p>
